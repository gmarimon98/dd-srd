[{"id":0,"href":"/character-creation/","title":"Character Creation","section":"Test","content":" Character Creation # To create a character, first communicate with your GM and group (ideally in a session zero) to come up with a concept that suits the setting and tone of the campaign. Once you have a solid concept, follow these steps:\nGet a Character Sheet. The playtest character sheet is available to print and as an online Google Sheet.\nFill in Character Details. Write your character’s name in the top-left corner of the sheet, then fill in each field below with your character’s personal details. This section has no mechanical or gameplay purpose and only exists to help you flesh out your character concept.\nRank Skills. From the list of nine skills, select one to have 5✦, two to have 4✦, three to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦. Fill in the appropriate number of stars for each on your character sheet. You cannot change or upgrade these values in the future, so make sure you’re satisfied with them.\nOne of the nine skills is an intentionally blank field. The GM can determine what this skill is to accommodate the setting. Ask the GM what skill they have selected and write it on the blank skill field on your sheet.\nCreate Traits. In the Traits section, write six tags representing who your character is and what forms their identity. Example traits include Scientist, Elf, Gigantic, Stubborn, Head of the Council, and Good Dad. Select two to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and two to have 1✦.\nCreate Assets. In the Assets section, write three tags representing external items or allies your character has access to. Example assets include Pet Cat, Assault Rifle, Full-Plate Armor, Haunted RV, Loyal Butler, and Back-Alley Hideout. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.\nCreate Abilities. Finally, in the Abilities section, write three tags representing special powers or moves your character can use. Example abilities include Fireball, Deduction, Telekinesis, Necromancy, Wrestling, and Biology. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.\nFill in Drive. Fill in the two stars under the Drive section.\nWrite Conflict(s). Optionally, write one or more of your character’s themes or conflicts under the Conflicts section. Example conflicts include New to Parenthood, Nature vs. Nurture, Refusing my Destiny, and Fighting for Freedom. If you can’t think of any immediately, feel free to skip this section. You can add or modify conflicts whenever you want during play.\nIf your GM approves of your character sheet, your character is done and now ready to play. All other fields (experience, stress, conditions, and drive) start out blank.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/character-sheet/skills/","title":"Skills","section":"On the Sheet","content":" Skills # Double Down has the following default skills:\nAgility.

Rolls have the following steps:\nSet Base Skill and Difficulty. The GM calls for a roll, setting a base skill (from the list of nine) and a difficulty (ranging from 6-30).\nAdd Stars. You create your die modifier by adding the stars on your character sheet from the following sources to form a total, ranging from -2 to +18. The sum of all the stars is your modifier; for example, 6✦ results in a modifier of +6.\nYou must add the roll’s base skill, which ranges from 1✦ to 5✦. You can optionally exhaust up to one relevant tag to add it (also ranging from 1✦ to 5✦). You can also exhaust a tag irrelevant to the attempt with a -1✦ penalty. After exhausting a tag, you cannot add it to other rolls until you recover it by resting or using boons. To mark it is exhausted, fill in the circle to the left of the tag on the character sheet. You can optionally add up to five drive, which are spent and you must erase from your sheet, with each drive granting you 1✦ and one boon if your outcome at the end of the roll is a success or higher. This drive boon is not multiplied by any tiers of success in the Outcomes Table. If you choose to apply drive, you must describe what unique strategy your character is using or why this attempt is particularly important to them. You must add stars from a positive condition if you have one, and subtract stars from a negative condition if you have one. After the roll, you can describe how any specific negative condition you may have affected your attempt to reduce its stars by one. Roll. You roll a 20-sided die and add your modifier. Then, based on the result, you achieve the following outcome, with critical outcomes taking priority over regular outcomes:\nIf the number on the die is a 20, your outcome is a critical success. If the number on the die is a 1, your outcome is a critical failure. If the total value rolled is greater to or equal than the difficulty, your outcome is a success. If the total value rolled is less than the difficulty, your outcome is a failure. Choose a Post-Roll Action. Depending on your outcome, you can optionally choose one of the following post-roll actions to modify it.\nDouble Down. Regardless of your roll’s outcome, you can choose to double down. If you double down, roll the same die again, adding the same modifier and comparing the result to the same difficulty. If you succeed the second roll, your original outcome is increased by one tier as per the Outcomes Table. If you critically succeed at the second roll, your outcome is increased by two tiers. If you fail the second roll, your outcome is decreased by one tier. If you critically fail the second roll, your outcome is decreased by two tiers. For example, increasing a Failure outcome by two tiers results in a Critical Success. Succeed at a Cost. If your outcome is a non-critical failure, you can choose to succeed at a cost. If you succeed at a cost, you succeed but incur banes equal to the difference between your total value rolled and the difficulty. For example, if you rolled a total of 14, but the difficulty was 16, you can succeed at a cost to succeed at the cost of 2 banes. Fold. If your outcome is a failure or critical failure, you can choose to fold. If you fold, you fail but gain one additional drive. Calculate Boons and Banes. With your final outcome, the GM refers to the Outcomes Table, calculating any resulting boons or banes based on the roll’s difficulty using the Difficulty Table. If the outcome has the effect “2x boons/banes,” the GM multiplies the number of boons or banes by the appropriate number, not multiplying any boons from drive. If you have any boons, you can spend them on effects from the Boons table. If you have any banes, the GM can spend them on effects from the Banes table. If in combat, the roll applies damage as stated in the Outcomes Table.\nGain Drive. If you fail the roll, you can describe why your character failed and attempt to connect it to the character’s flaws. If you do so, gain one drive. If you chose to fold in Step 4, gain two instead.\nFor a full example of a roll, if a character attempts to cross a precarious bridge, the GM may call for an Agility roll with a difficulty of 14. The player has 3✦ in Agility and decides to exhaust the Rogue trait to add its bonus of 2✦ to the roll as well. They also decide to spend one drive, adding 1✦ and a boon if the outcome is a success or higher. The player has added 6✦ to the roll, which totals to a modifier of +6. The player rolls a D20 and gets a 6, which added to the modifier of +6 results in 12: a failure. The player could fold or succeed at the cost of two banes, but instead opts to double down. They roll again and get a natural 20: a critical success. The original failure is upgraded two tiers to a critical success, resulting in four boons as per the Boons Table (plus one boon from the spent drive) and can spend that amount on any of the effects from that table. For example, with the five boons, they may give themselves a 2✦ condition called Adrenaline Rush and gain one drive, as they cross the bridge safely.\nIn Double Down, only players roll dice. Whenever other characters or enemies act, the GM imposes a roll on one or more players. For example, if a player character is attacked by a goblin, then the goblin does not roll; instead, the attacked player makes a defensive roll of the GM’s design (for example, a Toughness roll to block a charge attack).\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/character-sheet/conditions/","title":"Conditions","section":"On the Sheet","content":" Conditions # Conditions are special narrative status effects that either increase (positive conditions) or decrease (negative conditions) your stars before each roll, and then downgrade after the roll. For example, a positive 3✦ condition called Adrenaline Rush grants 3✦ to your next roll after acquiring it, then 2✦ to the next roll, and then 1✦ to the next roll. After each roll, erase one star from the condition. To downgrade a negative condition, you must narrate how that specific condition affected your attempt. For example, if you have the negative condition Limping and are trying to attack an enemy, you can describe how your character struggles to maintain their balance (or roleplay it) to downgrade that condition.\nYou can gain conditions through boons or banes. On your character sheet, you have one slot for a positive condition and one for a negative condition. If you have both a positive and a negative, they increase or decrease your stars equal to the difference. For example, having a 3✦ positive condition and a 2✦ negative condition nets you an additional 1✦. If you gain another condition of the same type (positive or negative) when you already have one, you must choose which condition to keep and discard the other.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/character-sheet/boons-and-banes/","title":"Boons and Banes","section":"On the Sheet","content":" Boons and Banes # Depending on your outcome, you may gain one or more boons to spend on the Boons Table or one or more banes for the GM to spend on the Banes Table.\nWhen selecting boons or banes, the target of the effect does not need to be the player character rolling, as long as the alternative is narratively justified. For example, if a player gets a critical success, they can spend the resulting boons to raise the morale of a nearby ally, restoring their stress or giving them a positive condition. Similarly, you can use boons to grant a positive condition to yourself or any ally or grant a negative condition to an enemy.\nIn the case that you apply drive to a roll and succeed at a cost, you gain both boons (from the drive) and banes (from succeeding at a cost). In this case, you can spend your boons first, and then the GM spends banes.\nTension # As a bane, the GM can choose to add one or more points of tension to the session. You can represent tension with any kind of tokens clearly visible at the center of the play area. When there’s tension in play, any failure can result in worse consequences. At any point when inflicting banes, the GM can choose to add any points of tension to increase the number of banes inflicted. For example, if there is three tension in play and a player’s roll results in a failure or lower, the GM can choose whether to spend each of those points of tension to add an additional bane for each tension spent (in this case, up to three).\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/character-sheet/stress-and-rest/","title":"Stress and Rest","section":"On the Sheet","content":" Stress and Rest # Stress represents physical injury and hurt morale, with each character taking up to a maximum of ten stress before being out. If you’re out, your character is still alive but cannot attempt or succeed at any rolls until recovered through rest. You cannot recover the stress of a character who is out through boons.\nIf a character rests for a considerable period of time (8-24 hours) in a non-stressful and safe environment, they rest. When you rest, clear all your stress and negative conditions and recover all your traits.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/character-sheet/regard/","title":"Regard","section":"On the Sheet","content":" Regard # You begin every session with two points of regard. Whenever another player character does something that makes an impression or furthers your relationship with them, whether positively or negatively, you can choose to give them one or more regard. Erase the chosen number of regard from your sheet, and grant them the same amount of drive.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/character-sheet/experience-and-conflicts/","title":"Experience and Conflicts","section":"On the Sheet","content":" Experience and Conflicts # At the end of each session, you gain 5 experience points. GMs can grant additional experience points as they see fit as a reward for accomplishing objectives in the campaign.\nDuring play, you can narrate your character’s training or progress to spend that experience on acquiring new tags or upgrading existing ones. How did they acquire this new tag? For example, you can narrate an arduous training session at a dojo and spend the appropriate amount of experience to upgrade a Martial Arts ability from 2✦ to 3✦. If you are spending experience points to acquire an item/asset, you can for example visit a shop and spend the experience there. For a full list of progression options, see the Experience Table.\nThere is no monetary currency in this system, only experience points.\nWhenever you want during play, you can add, remove, or modify up to three conflicts on your character sheet. Conflicts represent goals, themes, and issues that your character struggles with. Example conflicts include New to Parenthood, Nature vs. Nurture, Refusing my Destiny, and Fighting for Freedom.\nOnce per session, whenever you deal with a conflict during play, you can invest either 1 or 2 experience points into that conflict. Remove that amount of experience from your available experience field and add it to the conflict. Then, whenever that conflict reaches some climax, resolution, or progress, you can ask your GM to cash it out in order to regain all experience points you invested in it plus an additional 50% (rounded up). For example, if you cash out a conflict that has accrued 11 experience points, you would regain all 11 plus an additional 6.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/running-the-game/action-scenes/","title":"Action Scenes","section":"Running the Game","content":" Action Scenes # Action scenes are moments of gameplay where time slows down and every decision matters. The narration of the game goes from a conversational flow to a more structured turn-based flow. For example, combat and chase scenes are action scenes. In action scenes, the GM first establishes which sides are participating in the scene (usually just the players and their enemies, but there could be a third party as well) and which side starts. Each side takes one turn at a time. When it’s the players’ side’s turn, one member of that side can take the following actions:\nMove from one place to another Make one roll Make a second roll (requires that you spend a total of four drive and/or stress) Then, the opposing side takes a turn. However, only players roll dice. Whenever other characters or enemies act, the GM imposes a roll on one or more players. A member of a side cannot take another turn until all members of that side have taken a turn.\nCombat # Combat is a type of action scene where the players fight enemies. Enemies have the following attributes:\nA difficulty, ranging from 6 to 30 An HP value, ranging from 1 to around 10 A list of tags, each with a star value ranging from 1-5 A positive condition slot and negative condition slot (starts empty) For example, the following is a mid-level enemy:\nYoung Red Dragon\nDifficulty: 10 HP: 6 Tags: Fire Breath 4✦ Flying 3✦ Hardy Scales 3✦ Tail Swipe 2✦ Snapping Jaws 1✦ Razor Claws 1✦ When attacking an enemy, make a roll against their difficulty plus an additional tag of the GM’s choice and any conditions. An enemy’s tags are not exhausted after use. Instead, they cannot use that same tag again until they have used all other tags at least once. If the roll is successful, the player applies damage to the enemy’s HP based on the Outcomes Table.\nWhen attacking, you can also spend a total of two drive or stress to either: Attack an additional enemy with the same attack (the roll’s difficulty is equal to the highest one among targets). Attack an enemy that is out of reach (assuming you have a plausible ranged attack).\nWhen defending against an enemy, the player rolls defensively against the difficulty plus an additional tag of the GM’s choice and any conditions. If successful, the player can also apply damage when attacked, as per the Outcomes Table.\nExample Combat Roll # For example, a player chooses to attack the above Young Red Dragon, using their Combat skill (3✦), Broadsword (2✦), and one drive (1✦). In response, the Young Red Dragon uses its Tail Swipe (2✦) to try to keep its distance from the player character. This results in a modifier of +6 for the player (plus one boon if successful) and a difficulty of 12. The player rolls a 20 and scores a critical success, dealing 2 damage to the Young Red Dragon, bringing it down to 3 HP remaining. Because the attack resulted in a critical success, the player gains boons based on the Difficulty Table, gaining 4 boons (plus 1 from the spent drive) as per the difficulty 12 row.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/reference/","title":"Reference","section":"Test","content":" Reference # Outcomes # Outcome Effect Combat Legendary Success Gain 4x boons 4 damage Overwhelming Success Gain 2x boons 3 damage Critical Success Gain boons 2 damage Success - 1 damage Failure Suffer banes - Critical Failure Suffer 2x banes - Overwhelming Failure Suffer 4x banes - Legendary Failure Suffer 8x banes - "},{"id":10,"href":"/downloads/","title":"Downloads","section":"Test","content":" Downloads # some links here\n"}]
