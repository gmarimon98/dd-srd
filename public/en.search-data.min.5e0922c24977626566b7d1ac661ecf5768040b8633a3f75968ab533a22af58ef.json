Once you have a character concept you\u0026rsquo;re happy with, follow these steps:\nGet a Character Sheet. The form-fillable Double Down character sheet PDF is available for download.\nFill in Character Details. Write your character\u0026rsquo;s name at the top of the sheet, then fill in each field below with your character\u0026rsquo;s personal details (such as Motivations and Flaws). This section has no mehcanical or gameplay effect and only exists to help you further develop your character, so feel free to skip this step if you want more time to brainstorm your character\u0026rsquo;s personality.\nRank your Skills. From the list of nine default skills, select one to have 5✦, two to have 4✦, three to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦. Fill in the appropriate number of stars for each on your character sheet. You cannot upgrade or change these values in the future, so make sure you’re happy with them.\nOne of the nine skills is an intentionally blank field. The GM can determine what this skill is to accommodate the setting. Ask the GM what skill they have selected and write it on the blank skill field on your sheet. Create Tags. Tags are narrative details about your character that are leveled (from 1 to 5) and can provide a bonus to your rolls. The following are the three types of tags.\nCreate Traits. In the Traits section, write six tags representing who your character is and what forms their identity. Example traits include Scientist, Elf, Gigantic, Stubborn, Head of the Council, and Good Dad. Select two to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and two to have 1✦.\nCreate Assets. In the Assets section, write three tags representing external items or allies your character has access to. Example assets include Pet Cat, Assault Rifle, Full-Plate Armor, Haunted RV, Loyal Butler, and Back-Alley Hideout. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.\nCreate Abilities. In the Abilities section, write three tags representing special powers or moves your character can use. Example abilities include Fireball, Deduction, Telekinesis, Necromancy, Wrestling, and Biology. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.\nFill in Drive. Fill in the two stars under the Drive section.\nWrite Conflict(s). Optionally, write one or more of your character’s struggles, themes, or conflicts under the Conflicts section. Example conflicts include New to Parenthood, Nature vs. Nurture, Refusing my Destiny, and Fighting for Freedom. If you can’t think of any immediately, feel free to skip this section. You can add or modify conflicts whenever you want during play.\nIf your GM approves of your character sheet, your character is done and now ready to play. All other fields (experience, stress, conditions, and drive) start out blank.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/character-stats/skills/","title":"Skills","section":"Character Stats","content":" Skills # Double Down has the following default skills:\nAgility.

You can only add one tag to a roll.\nThe following are the three types of tags. The different types of tags are functionally identical except for your starting amount in each type during character creation.\nTraits represent who your character is and what forms their identity. Example traits include Scientist, Elf, Gigantic, Stubborn, Head of the Council, and Good Dad.\nAssets represent external items or allies your character has access to. Example assets include Pet Cat, Assault Rifle, Full-Plate Armor, Haunted RV, Loyal Butler, and Back-Alley Hideout.\nAbilities represent special powers or moves your character can use. Example abilities include Fireball, Deduction, Telekinesis, Necromancy, Wrestling, and Biology.\nOnce you exhaust a tag, you cannot benefit from its bonus again until it\u0026rsquo;s recovered. You can recover tags through boons or rest.\nA tag being exhausted does not remove its presence in your character or the narrative. For example, if you have the ability Teleportation and exhaust it, you can still teleport in the story while it is exhausted. You just can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from the Teleportation tag when rolling to do so.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/gameplay/rolling-dice/","title":"Rolls","section":"Gameplay","content":" Rolls # Whenever your character attempts something with a significant chance of failure, the GM may call for a roll. Rolls have the following steps.\nSet Base Skill and Difficulty. The GM sets a relevant base skill from the skill list (for example, Agility to cross a rickety bridge) and a difficulty from 6 (very easy) to 30 (near impossible).\nAdd Stars. Create your die modifier (ranging from -2 to +18) by adding up the stars on your character sheet from the following sources. The total is your modifier. For example, 6✦ results in a modifier of +6.\nYou must add stars from the roll\u0026rsquo;s base skill, which range from 1 to 5. You must add and subtract stars from any conditions you may have. Describe how those specific conditions affect your character\u0026rsquo;s attempt. After the roll, downgrade any conditions you have; for example, from 3✦ to 2✦. You can optionally exhaust up to one tag relevant to the attempt to add its stars, which range from 1 to 5. To exhaust a tag, fill in the circle next to it on your character sheet. After exhausting a tag, you cannot exhaust it again until you recover it through boons or rest. You can also exhaust a tag irrelevant to the attempt to gain its bonus, but at a -1✦ penalty. You can optionally spend up to five drive to gain that amount of stars, plus that amount of boons on a success or higher (not multiplied by critical effects). Describe what unique strategy your character is using or why this attempt is particularly important to them. Roll. Roll a 20-sided die and add your modifier, resulting in one of the following outcomes. Critical outcomes take priority over non-critical outcomes.\nIf you roll a natural 20, your outcome is a critical success. If you roll a natural 1, your outcome is a critical failure. If the total value rolled is greater to or equal than the difficulty, your outcome is a success. If the total value rolled is less than the difficulty, your outcome is a failure. Choose a Post-Roll Action. Optionally, choose one of the following post-roll actions.\nDouble Down. Roll the same die again, add the same modifier, and compare it to the same difficulty. If you succeed your second roll, your original outcome increases by one tier on the Outcomes table (for example, from a success to a critical success). If you roll a natural 20, your original outcome instead increases by two tiers. If you fail your second roll, your original outcome decreases by one tier. If you roll a natural 1, your original outcome instaed decreases by two tiers. Succeed at a Cost. If your outcome is a non-critical failure, succeed but incur banes equal to the difference between your total value rolled and the difficulty. For example, if the difficulty was 16 and you rolled a total of 10, you can succeed at a cost to change your outcome to a success at the cost of 6 banes. Fold. If your outcome is any tier of failure, gain one additional drive. Calculate Boons and Banes. With your final outcome, the GM refers to the Outcomes Table to determine whether you earned boons or incurred banes, keeping note of any multiplier the outcome may list. If the outcome results in boons or banes, the GM then refers to the Difficulty Table to see how many, multiplying the total by the multiplier in the Outcomes table. Boons from drive are not multiplied in this way.\nIf your roll resulted in boons, spend them in the Boons Table. If your roll resulted in banes, the GM spends them in the Banes Table. Deal Damage. If in combat, deal damage based on your outcome in the Outcomes Table.\nGain Drive. If your outcome is any tier of failure, gain one drive (or two if you chose the Fold action in Step 4). Describe why your character failed and try to connect it to your character\u0026rsquo;s flaws.\nIn Double Down, only players roll dice. Whenever other characters or enemies act, the GM imposes a roll on one or more players. For example, if a player character is attacked by a goblin, then the goblin does not roll; instead, the attacked player makes a defensive roll of the GM’s design (for example, a Toughness roll to block a charge attack).\nIf a player\u0026rsquo;s roll exclusively aims to gain benefits from the Boons table, such as when trying to heal another character\u0026rsquo;s stress, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to spend drive on that roll in order to gain boons more consistently.\nExample Roll # For a full example of a roll:\nIf a character attempts to cross a precarious bridge, the GM may call for an Agility roll with a difficulty of 14. The player has 3✦ in Agility and has no conditions. They decide to exhaust the Rogue trait to add its bonus of 2✦ to the roll as well. They also decide to spend one drive, adding 1✦ and a boon if the outcome is a success or higher. The player has added 6✦ to the roll, which totals to a modifier of +6. The player rolls a D20 and gets a 6, which added to the modifier of +6 results in 12: a failure. The player could fold or succeed at the cost of two banes, but instead opts to double down. They roll again and get a natural 20: a critical success. The original failure is upgraded two tiers to a critical success. The critical success results in four boons (plus one boon from the spent drive) and the player can spend that amount on any of the effects from the Boons table. For example, with the five boons, they may give themselves a 2✦ condition called Adrenaline Rush and gain one drive, as they cross the bridge safely. Since the player is not in combat, they do not deal damage. Since the player did not fail, they do not gain drive. "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/character-stats/conditions/","title":"Conditions","section":"Character Stats","content":" Conditions # Conditions are special narrative status effects that either increase (positive conditions) or decrease (negative conditions) your stars before each roll, and then downgrade after the roll.\nFor example, a positive 3✦ condition called Adrenaline Rush grants 3✦ to your next roll after acquiring it, then 2✦ to the next roll, and then 1✦ to the next roll. After each roll, erase one star from the condition. When a condition affects your roll, you must narrate how that specific condition affected your attempt. For example, if you have the negative condition Limping and are trying to attack an enemy, you can describe how your character struggles to maintain their balance (or roleplay it).\nYou can gain conditions through boons or banes. On your character sheet, you have one slot for a positive condition and one for a negative condition. If you have both a positive and a negative, they increase or decrease your stars equal to the difference. For example, having a 3✦ positive condition and a 2✦ negative condition nets you an additional 1✦. If you gain another condition of the same type (positive or negative) when you already have one, you must choose which condition to keep and discard the other.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/gameplay/boons-and-banes/","title":"Boons \u0026 Banes","section":"Gameplay","content":" Boons \u0026amp; Banes # Depending on your outcome, you may gain one or more boons to spend on the Boons Table or one or more banes for the GM to spend on the Banes Table.\nWith a roll\u0026rsquo;s final outcome, the GM refers to the Outcomes Table to determine whether you earned boons or incurred banes, keeping note of any multiplier the outcome may list. If the outcome results in boons or banes, the GM then refers to the Difficulty Table to see how many, multiplying the total by the multiplier in the Outcomes table. Boons from drive are not multiplied in this way.\nWhen selecting boons or banes, the target of the effect does not need to be the player character rolling, as long as the alternative is narratively justified. For example, if a player gets a critical success, they can spend the resulting boons to raise the morale of a nearby ally, restoring their stress or giving them a positive condition. Similarly, you can use boons to grant a positive condition to yourself or any ally or grant a negative condition to an enemy.\nIn the case that you apply drive to a roll and succeed at a cost, you gain both boons (from the drive) and banes (from succeeding at a cost). In this case, you can spend your boons first, and then the GM spends banes.\nTension # As a bane, the GM can choose to add one or more points of tension to the session. You can represent tension with any kind of tokens clearly visible at the center of the play area. When there’s tension in play, any failure can result in worse consequences. At any point when inflicting banes, the GM can choose to add any points of tension to increase the number of banes inflicted. For example, if there is three tension in play and a player’s roll results in a failure or lower, the GM can choose whether to spend each of those points of tension to add an additional bane for each tension spent (in this case, up to three).\nStory Rewards and Complications # When a player selects the Gain a story reward boon option, they may spend any amount of boons they have to gain a surprise narrative benefit of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice, roughly proportional to the amount of boons spent. For example, a story reward could earn a player a new ally, a shiny piece of loot, a convenient discovery, or decreased difficulties for the rest of the scene.\nSimilarly, when a GM selects the Complicate the story bane option, they do the same with narrative obstacles. For example, a story complication could introduce new danger to a scene, force the players to make a difficult choice, or even give the players a negative reputation in the future.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/character-stats/stress/","title":"Stress","section":"Character Stats","content":" Stress and Rest # Stress represents physical injury and hurt morale, with each character taking up to a maximum of ten stress before being out. If you’re out, your character is still alive but cannot attempt or succeed at any rolls until recovered through rest. You cannot recover the stress of a character who is out through boons.\nIf a character rests for a considerable period of time (8-24 hours) in a non-stressful and safe environment, they rest. When you rest, clear all your stress and negative conditions and recover all your traits.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/character-stats/drive/","title":"Drive","section":"Character Stats","content":" Drive # Drive is a meta-resource that players can use to boost their rolls. When rolling, you optionally spend up to five drive to gain that amount of stars, plus that amount of boons on a success or higher (not multiplied by critical effects). Describe what unique strategy your character is using or why this attempt is particularly important to them.\nDrive represents not only a player character\u0026rsquo;s level of motivation, but every narrative detail that is not already a tag on a character sheet. For example, if a character is trying to sneak around in the rain and they apply drive, they could argue that the cover of the weather might help them be stealthier.\nYou can gain drive through the following methods:\nFailing rolls Boons Regard Regard # You begin every session with two points of regard. Whenever another player character does something that makes an impression or furthers your relationship with them, whether positively or negatively, you can choose to give them one or more regard. Erase the chosen number of regard from your sheet, and grant them the same amount of drive.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/character-stats/experience/","title":"Experience","section":"Character Stats","content":" Experience # At the end of each session, you gain 5 experience points. GMs can grant additional experience points or tags to one or more players as they see fit as a reward for accomplishing objectives in the campaign.\nDuring play, you can narrate your character’s training or progress to spend that experience on acquiring new tags or upgrading existing ones. How did they acquire this new or improved tag? For example, you can narrate an arduous training session at a dojo and spend the appropriate amount of experience to upgrade a Martial Arts ability from 2✦ to 3✦. If you are spending experience points to acquire an asset, you can for example visit a shop and spend the experience there. For a full list of progression options, see the Experience Table.\nThere is no monetary currency in this system, only experience points.\nAssuming players can full advantage of the conflicts mechanic to gain an additional 1 experience per session (for a total of 6), increasing all your starting tags to 5✦ takes around 30 sessions of play.\nConflicts # Whenever you want during play, you can add, remove, or modify up to three conflicts on your character sheet. Conflicts represent goals, themes, and issues that your character struggles with. Example conflicts include New to Parenthood, Nature vs. Nurture, Refusing my Destiny, and Fighting for Freedom.\nOnce per session, whenever you deal with a conflict during play, you can invest either 1 or 2 experience points into that conflict. Remove that amount of experience from your available experience field and add it to the conflict. Then, whenever that conflict reaches some climax, resolution, or progress, you can ask your GM to cash it out in order to regain all experience points you invested in it plus an additional 50% (rounded up). For example, if you cash out a conflict that has accrued 11 experience points, you would regain all 11 plus an additional 6.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/gameplay/action-scenes/","title":"Action Scenes","section":"Gameplay","content":" Action Scenes # Action scenes are critical moments of gameplay where the narration of the game goes from a conversational flow to a more structured turn-based flow. Time slows down and every decision matters. For example, a combat against some bandits or a car chase are action scenes.\nIn action scenes, the GM first establishes which sides are participating in the scene (usually just the players and their enemies, but there could be a third side as well) and which side stars. Each side takes one turn at a time. When it’s the players’ side’s turn, one member of that side can take the following actions:\nMove from one place to another Make one roll Make a second roll (requires that you spend a total of four drive and/or stress) Then, the opposing side takes a turn. However, only players roll dice. Whenever other characters or enemies act, the GM imposes a roll on one or more players. A member of a side cannot take another turn until all members of that side have taken a turn.\nCombat # Combat is a type of action scene where the players fight enemies. Enemies have the following attributes:\nA difficulty, ranging from 6 to 30 An HP value, ranging from 1 to around 10 A list of tags, each with a star value ranging from 1-5 A positive condition slot and negative condition slot (starts empty) For example, the following is a mid-level enemy:\nYoung Red Dragon\nDifficulty: 10 HP: 8 Tags: Fire Breath 4✦ Flying 3✦ Hardy Scales 3✦ Tail Swipe 2✦ Snapping Jaws 1✦ Razor Claws 1✦ When attacking an enemy, make a roll against their difficulty plus an additional tag of the GM’s choice and any conditions. An enemy’s tags are not exhausted after use. Instead, the enemy cannot use that same tag again until they have used all other tags at least once. If the roll is successful, the player applies damage to the enemy’s HP based on the Outcomes Table.\nWhen attacking, you can also spend a total of two drive or stress to either:\nAttack an additional enemy with the same attack (the roll’s difficulty is equal to the highest one among targets) Attack an enemy that is out of reach (assuming you have a plausible ranged attack) When defending against an enemy, the player rolls defensively against the difficulty plus an additional tag of the GM’s choice and any conditions. If successful, the player can also apply damage when attacked, as per the Outcomes Table.\nExample Combat Roll # For example, a player chooses to attack the above Young Red Dragon, using their Combat skill (3✦), Broadsword (2✦), and one drive (1✦). In response, the Young Red Dragon uses its Tail Swipe (2✦) to try to keep its distance from the player character. This results in a modifier of +6 for the player (plus one boon if successful) and a difficulty of 12. The player rolls a 20 and scores a critical success, dealing 2 damage to the Young Red Dragon, bringing it down to 6 HP remaining. Because the attack resulted in a critical success, the player gains boons based on the Difficulty Table, gaining 4 boons (plus 1 from the spent drive) as per the difficulty 12 row.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/reference/","title":"Reference","section":"Docs","content":" Reference # Outcomes # Outcome Effect Combat Legendary Success Gain 4x boons 4 damage Overwhelming Success Gain 2x boons 3 damage Critical Success Gain boons 2 damage Success - 1 damage Failure Suffer banes - Critical Failure Suffer 2x banes - Overwhelming Failure Suffer 4x banes - Legendary Failure Suffer 8x banes - Difficulty # Difficulty Boons Banes 6-10 2 1 11-15 4 2 16-20 6 3 21-25 8 4 26-30 10 5 Boons # Cost Effect 1 boon Recover stress 2 boons Recover tag 2 boons Gain drive 1/3/6 boons Grant a ✦/✦✦/✦✦✦ condition X boons Gain a story reward Banes # Cost Effect 1 bane Inflict stress 2 banes Add tension 1/3/6 banes Grant a ✦/✦✦/✦✦✦ condition X banes Complicate the story Experience # Cost Effect 1 experience Gain a new 1✦ tag 3 experience Upgrade a 1✦ tag to 2✦ 5 experience Upgrade a 2✦ tag to 3✦ 7 experience Upgrade a 3✦ tag to 4✦ 9 experience Upgrade a 4✦ tag to 5✦ Storytelling Requirements # Context Requirement When applying drive\u0026hellip; What unique strategy are you using to give you an advantage, or why is this attempt particularly important to you?
