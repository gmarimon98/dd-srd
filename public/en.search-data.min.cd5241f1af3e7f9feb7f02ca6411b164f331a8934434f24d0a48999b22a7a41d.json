Once you have a solid concept, follow these steps:\nGet a Character Sheet. The playtest character sheet is available to print and as an online Google Sheet.\nFill in Character Details. Write your character’s name in the top-left corner of the sheet, then fill in each field below with your character’s personal details. This section has no mechanical or gameplay purpose and only exists to help you flesh out your character concept.\nRank Skills. From the list of nine skills, select one to have 5✦, two to have 4✦, three to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦. Fill in the appropriate number of stars for each on your character sheet. You cannot change or upgrade these values in the future, so make sure you’re satisfied with them.\nOne of the nine skills is an intentionally blank field. The GM can determine what this skill is to accommodate the setting. Ask the GM what skill they have selected and write it on the blank skill field on your sheet.\nCreate Traits. In the Traits section, write six tags representing who your character is and what forms their identity. Example traits include Scientist, Elf, Gigantic, Stubborn, Head of the Council, and Good Dad. Select two to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and two to have 1✦.\nCreate Assets. In the Assets section, write three tags representing external items or allies your character has access to. Example assets include Pet Cat, Assault Rifle, Full-Plate Armor, Haunted RV, Loyal Butler, and Back-Alley Hideout. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.\nCreate Abilities. Finally, in the Abilities section, write three tags representing special powers or moves your character can use. Example abilities include Fireball, Deduction, Telekinesis, Necromancy, Wrestling, and Biology. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.\nFill in Drive. Fill in the two stars under the Drive section.\nWrite Conflict(s). Optionally, write one or more of your character’s themes or conflicts under the Conflicts section. Example conflicts include New to Parenthood, Nature vs. Nurture, Refusing my Destiny, and Fighting for Freedom. If you can’t think of any immediately, feel free to skip this section. You can add or modify conflicts whenever you want during play.\nIf your GM approves of your character sheet, your character is done and now ready to play. All other fields (experience, stress, conditions, and drive) start out blank.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/character-creation-copy/","title":"Creation 3","section":"Test","content":"bazinga\n"}]
