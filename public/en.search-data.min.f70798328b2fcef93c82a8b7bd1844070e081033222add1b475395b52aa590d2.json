[{"id":0,"href":"/character-creation-copy/","title":"Character Creation","section":"Test","content":" Character Creation # To create a character, first communicate with your GM and group (ideally in a session zero) to come up with a concept that suits the setting and tone of the campaign. Once you have a solid concept, follow these steps:\nGet a Character Sheet. The playtest character sheet is available to print and as an online Google Sheet.\nFill in Character Details. Write your character’s name in the top-left corner of the sheet, then fill in each field below with your character’s personal details. This section has no mechanical or gameplay purpose and only exists to help you flesh out your character concept.\nRank Skills. From the list of nine skills, select one to have 5✦, two to have 4✦, three to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦. Fill in the appropriate number of stars for each on your character sheet. You cannot change or upgrade these values in the future, so make sure you’re satisfied with them.\nOne of the nine skills is an intentionally blank field. The GM can determine what this skill is to accommodate the setting. Ask the GM what skill they have selected and write it on the blank skill field on your sheet.\nCreate Traits. In the Traits section, write six tags representing who your character is and what forms their identity. Example traits include Scientist, Elf, Gigantic, Stubborn, Head of the Council, and Good Dad. Select two to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and two to have 1✦.\nCreate Assets. In the Assets section, write three tags representing external items or allies your character has access to. Example assets include Pet Cat, Assault Rifle, Full-Plate Armor, Haunted RV, Loyal Butler, and Back-Alley Hideout. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.\nCreate Abilities. Finally, in the Abilities section, write three tags representing special powers or moves your character can use. Example abilities include Fireball, Deduction, Telekinesis, Necromancy, Wrestling, and Biology. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.\nFill in Drive. Fill in the two stars under the Drive section.\nWrite Conflict(s). Optionally, write one or more of your character’s themes or conflicts under the Conflicts section. Example conflicts include New to Parenthood, Nature vs. Nurture, Refusing my Destiny, and Fighting for Freedom. If you can’t think of any immediately, feel free to skip this section. You can add or modify conflicts whenever you want during play.\nIf your GM approves of your character sheet, your character is done and now ready to play. All other fields (experience, stress, conditions, and drive) start out blank.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/skills/","title":"Skills","section":"Test","content":" Skills # Double Down has the following default skills:\nAgility.

Ask the GM what skill they have selected and write it on the blank skill field on your sheet.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/rolling-dice/","title":"Rolling Dice","section":"Test","content":" Rolling Dice # Whenever your character attempts something risky, the GM may call for a roll. Rolls have the following steps:\nSet Base Skill and Difficulty. The GM calls for a roll, setting a base skill (from the list of nine) and a difficulty (ranging from 6-30).\nAdd Stars. You create your die modifier by adding the stars on your character sheet from the following sources to form a total, ranging from -2 to +18. The sum of all the stars is your modifier; for example, 6✦ results in a modifier of +6.\nYou must add the roll’s base skill, which ranges from 1✦ to 5✦. You can optionally exhaust up to one relevant tag to add it (also ranging from 1✦ to 5✦). You can also exhaust a tag irrelevant to the attempt with a -1✦ penalty. After exhausting a tag, you cannot add it to other rolls until you recover it by resting or using boons. To mark it is exhausted, fill in the circle to the left of the tag on the character sheet. You can optionally add up to five drive, which are spent and you must erase from your sheet, with each drive granting you 1✦ and one boon if your outcome at the end of the roll is a success or higher. This drive boon is not multiplied by any tiers of success in the Outcomes Table. If you choose to apply drive, you must describe what unique strategy your character is using or why this attempt is particularly important to them. You must add stars from a positive condition if you have one, and subtract stars from a negative condition if you have one. After the roll, you can describe how any specific negative condition you may have affected your attempt to reduce its stars by one. Roll. You roll a 20-sided die and add your modifier. Then, based on the result, you achieve the following outcome, with critical outcomes taking priority over regular outcomes:\nIf the number on the die is a 20, your outcome is a critical success. If the number on the die is a 1, your outcome is a critical failure. If the total value rolled is greater to or equal than the difficulty, your outcome is a success. If the total value rolled is less than the difficulty, your outcome is a failure. Choose a Post-Roll Action. Depending on your outcome, you can optionally choose one of the following post-roll actions to modify it.\nDouble Down. Regardless of your roll’s outcome, you can choose to double down. If you double down, roll the same die again, adding the same modifier and comparing the result to the same difficulty. If you succeed the second roll, your original outcome is increased by one tier as per the Outcomes Table. If you critically succeed at the second roll, your outcome is increased by two tiers. If you fail the second roll, your outcome is decreased by one tier. If you critically fail the second roll, your outcome is decreased by two tiers. For example, increasing a Failure outcome by two tiers results in a Critical Success. Succeed at a Cost. If your outcome is a non-critical failure, you can choose to succeed at a cost. If you succeed at a cost, you succeed but incur banes equal to the difference between your total value rolled and the difficulty. For example, if you rolled a total of 14, but the difficulty was 16, you can succeed at a cost to succeed at the cost of 2 banes. Fold. If your outcome is a failure or critical failure, you can choose to fold. If you fold, you fail but gain one additional drive. Calculate Boons and Banes. With your final outcome, the GM refers to the Outcomes Table, calculating any resulting boons or banes based on the roll’s difficulty using the Difficulty Table. If the outcome has the effect “2x boons/banes,” the GM multiplies the number of boons or banes by the appropriate number, not multiplying any boons from drive. If you have any boons, you can spend them on effects from the Boons table. If you have any banes, the GM can spend them on effects from the Banes table. If in combat, the roll applies damage as stated in the Outcomes Table.\nGain Drive. If you fail the roll, you can describe why your character failed and attempt to connect it to the character’s flaws. If you do so, gain one drive. If you chose to fold in Step 4, gain two instead.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/conditions/","title":"Conditions","section":"Test","content":" Conditions # Conditions are special narrative status effects that either increase (positive conditions) or decrease (negative conditions) your stars before each roll, and then downgrade after the roll. For example, a positive 3✦ condition called Adrenaline Rush grants 3✦ to your next roll after acquiring it, then 2✦ to the next roll, and then 1✦ to the next roll. After each roll, erase one star from the condition. To downgrade a negative condition, you must narrate how that specific condition affected your attempt. For example, if you have the negative condition Limping and are trying to attack an enemy, you can describe how your character struggles to maintain their balance (or roleplay it) to downgrade that condition.\nYou can gain conditions through boons or banes. On your character sheet, you have one slot for a positive condition and one for a negative condition. If you have both a positive and a negative, they increase or decrease your stars equal to the difference. For example, having a 3✦ positive condition and a 2✦ negative condition nets you an additional 1✦. If you gain another condition of the same type (positive or negative) when you already have one, you must choose which condition to keep and discard the other.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/boons-and-banes/","title":"Boons and Banes","section":"Test","content":" Boons and Banes # Depending on your outcome, you may gain one or more boons to spend on the Boons Table or one or more banes for the GM to spend on the Banes Table.\nWhen selecting boons or banes, the target of the effect does not need to be the player character rolling, as long as the alternative is narratively justified. For example, if a player gets a critical success, they can spend the resulting boons to raise the morale of a nearby ally, restoring their stress or giving them a positive condition. Similarly, you can use boons to grant a positive condition to yourself or any ally or grant a negative condition to an enemy.\nIn the case that you apply drive to a roll and succeed at a cost, you gain both boons (from the drive) and banes (from succeeding at a cost). In this case, you can spend your boons first, and then the GM spends banes.\nTension # As a bane, the GM can choose to add one or more points of tension to the session. You can represent tension with any kind of tokens clearly visible at the center of the play area. When there’s tension in play, any failure can result in worse consequences. At any point when inflicting banes, the GM can choose to add any points of tension to increase the number of banes inflicted. For example, if there is three tension in play and a player’s roll results in a failure or lower, the GM can choose whether to spend each of those points of tension to add an additional bane for each tension spent (in this case, up to three).\n"}]
