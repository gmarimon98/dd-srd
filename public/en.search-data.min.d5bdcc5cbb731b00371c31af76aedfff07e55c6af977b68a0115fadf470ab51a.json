Once you have a character concept you\u0026rsquo;re happy with, follow these steps:\nGet a Character Sheet. The Double Down character sheet PDF is available for download.\nFill in Character Details. Write your character\u0026rsquo;s name at the top of the sheet, then fill in each field below with your character\u0026rsquo;s personal details (such as Motivations and Flaws). This section has no mehcanical or gameplay effect and only exists to help you further develop your character, so feel free to skip this step if you want more time to brainstorm your character\u0026rsquo;s personality.\nRank your Stats. From the list of nine default stats, select one to have 5✦, two to have 4✦, three to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦. Fill in the appropriate number of stars for each on your character sheet. You cannot upgrade or change these values in the future, so make sure you’re happy with them.\nOne of the nine stats is an intentionally blank field. The GM can determine what this stat is to accommodate the setting. Ask the GM what stat they have selected and write it on the blank stat field on your sheet. Create Tags. Tags are narrative details about your character, each with a level from 1✦ to 5✦, that can provide a bonus to your rolls. Create four tags with 3✦, four tags with 2✦, and four tags with 1✦. For example, tags can be the following:\nTags can represent who your character is and what forms their identity. For example, Scientist, Elf, Gigantic, Stubborn, Head of the Council, and Good Dad.\nTags can represent external items or allies your character has access to. For example, Pet Cat, Assault Rifle, Full-Plate Armor, Haunted RV, Loyal Butler, and Back-Alley Hideout.\nTags can represent special powers or moves your character can use. For example, Fireball, Deduction, Telekinesis, Necromancy, Wrestling, and Biology.\nIf your GM approves of your character sheet, your character is done and now ready to play. All other fields (experience, stress, and drive) start out blank.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/character-stats/stats/","title":"Stats","section":"Character Stats","content":" Stats # Double Down has the following default stats:\nAgility (AGI): Represents how quick, nimble, balanced, or stealthy you are. Used to walk tightropes, dodge certain attacks, do parkour, and sneak around. Charisma (CHA): Represents how able you are to influence others, whether positively or negatively. Used to persuade, intimidate, and lie. Combat (COM): Represents how trained you are in combat. Used to hunt, spar, and take down enemies. Intelligence (INT): Represents your intellect and recall. Used to solve puzzles and remember obscure or important information. Perception (PER): Represents the acuity of your senses. Used to spot clues, search a messy room for a lost item, and see a trap before it springs. Proficiency (PRO): Represents how practical and technically savvy you are. Used to drive cars, pick locks, and cook a nice meal. Toughness (TOU): Represents how physically strong and resilient you are. Used to defend from certain attacks, lift heavy objects, and wrestle. Wisdom (WIS): Represents how attuned you are to others. Used to gain insight into someone else and heal or support them, or interact with animals.

You can only add one tag to a roll.\nFor example, tags can represent any of the following:\nTags can represent who your character is and what forms their identity. For example, Scientist, Elf, Gigantic, Stubborn, Head of the Council, and Good Dad.\nTags can represent external items or allies your character has access to.

For example, Fireball, Deduction, Telekinesis, Necromancy, Wrestling, and Biology.\nOnce you exhaust a tag, you cannot benefit from its bonus again until it\u0026rsquo;s recovered. You can recover tags through boons or rest.\nA tag being exhausted does not remove its presence in your character or the narrative. For example, if you have the tag Teleportation and exhaust it, you can still teleport in the story while it is exhausted. You just can\u0026rsquo;t benefit from the Teleportation tag when rolling to do so.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/gameplay/rolls/","title":"Rolls","section":"Gameplay","content":" Rolls # Whenever your character attempts something with a significant chance of failure, the GM may call for a roll. Rolls have the following steps.\nSet Base Stat and Difficulty. The GM sets a relevant base stat from the stat list (for example, Agility to cross a rickety bridge) and a difficulty from 10 (easy) to 25 or more (impossible).\nAdd Stars. Create your die modifier (ranging from -3 to +15) by adding up the stars on your character sheet from the following sources. The total is your modifier. For example, 6✦ results in a modifier of +6.\nYou must add stars from the roll\u0026rsquo;s base stat, which range from 1 to 5. You must subtract stars based on any penalties you have reached from taking stress. You can optionally exhaust up to one tag relevant to the attempt to add its stars, which range from 1 to 5. To exhaust a tag, fill in the circle next to it on your character sheet. After exhausting a tag, you cannot exhaust it again until you recover it through boons or rest. You can also exhaust a tag irrelevant to the attempt to gain its bonus, but at a -1✦ penalty. You can optionally spend up to five drive to gain that amount of stars, plus that amount of boons on a success or higher (not multiplied by critical effects). Describe what unique strategy your character is using or why this attempt is particularly important to them. Roll. Roll a 20-sided die and add your modifier, resulting in one of the following outcomes. Critical outcomes take priority over non-critical outcomes.\nIf you roll a natural 20, your outcome is a critical success. If you roll a natural 1, your outcome is a critical failure. If the total value rolled is greater to or equal than the difficulty, your outcome is a success. If the total value rolled is less than the difficulty, your outcome is a failure. Choose a Post-Roll Action. Optionally, choose one of the following post-roll actions.\nDouble Down. Roll the same die again, add the same modifier, and compare it to the same difficulty. If you succeed your second roll, your original outcome increases by one tier on the Outcomes table (for example, from a success to a critical success). If you roll a natural 20, your original outcome instead increases by two tiers. If you fail your second roll, your original outcome decreases by one tier. If you roll a natural 1, your original outcome instaed decreases by two tiers. Succeed at a Cost. If your outcome is a non-critical failure, succeed but incur banes equal to the difference between your total value rolled and the difficulty. For example, if the difficulty was 16 and you rolled a total of 10, you can succeed at a cost to change your outcome to a success at the cost of 6 banes. Fold. If your outcome is any tier of failure, gain one additional drive. Calculate Boons and Banes. With your final outcome, the GM refers to the Outcomes Table to determine whether you earned boons or incurred banes, keeping note of any multiplier the outcome may list. If the outcome results in boons or banes, the GM then refers to the Difficulty Table to see how many, multiplying the total by the multiplier in the Outcomes table. Boons from drive are not multiplied in this way.\nIf your roll resulted in boons, spend them in the Boons Table. If your roll resulted in banes, the GM spends them in the Banes Table. Deal Damage. If in combat, deal damage based on your outcome in the Outcomes Table.\nGain Drive. If your outcome is any tier of failure, gain one drive (or two if you chose the Fold action in Step 4). Describe why your character failed and try to connect it to your character\u0026rsquo;s flaws.\nIn Double Down, only players roll dice. Whenever other characters or enemies act, the GM imposes a roll on one or more players. For example, if a player character is attacked by a goblin, then the goblin does not roll; instead, the attacked player makes a defensive roll of the GM’s design (for example, a Toughness roll to block a charge attack).\nIf a player\u0026rsquo;s roll exclusively aims to gain benefits from the Boons table, such as when trying to heal another character\u0026rsquo;s stress, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to spend drive on that roll in order to gain boons more consistently.\nExample Roll # For a full example of a roll:\nIf a character attempts to cross a precarious bridge, the GM may call for an Agility roll with a difficulty of 14. The player has 3✦ in Agility. They decide to exhaust the Rogue tag to add its bonus of 2✦ to the roll as well. They also decide to spend one drive, adding 1✦ and a boon if the outcome is a success or higher. The player has added 6✦ to the roll, which totals to a modifier of +6. The player rolls a D20 and gets a 6, which added to the modifier of +6 results in 12: a failure. The player could fold or succeed at the cost of two banes, but instead opts to double down. They roll again and get a natural 20: a critical success. The original failure is upgraded two tiers to a critical success. The critical success results in four boons (plus one boon from the spent drive) and the player can spend that amount on any of the effects from the Boons table. For example, with the five boons, they may give themselves two drive and recover one stress. Since the player is not in combat, they do not deal damage. Since the player did not fail, they do not gain drive. "},{"id":4,"href":"/gameplay/boons-and-banes/","title":"Boons \u0026 Banes","section":"Gameplay","content":" Boons \u0026amp; Banes # Depending on your outcome, you may gain one or more boons to spend on the Boons Table or one or more banes for the GM to spend on the Banes Table.\nWith a roll\u0026rsquo;s final outcome, the GM refers to the Outcomes Table to determine whether you earned boons or incurred banes, keeping note of any multiplier the outcome may list. If the outcome results in boons or banes, the GM then refers to the Difficulty Table to see how many, multiplying the total by the multiplier in the Outcomes table. Boons from drive are not multiplied in this way.\nWhen selecting boons or banes, the target of the effect does not need to be the player character rolling, as long as the alternative is narratively justified. For example, if a player gets a critical success, they can spend the resulting boons to raise the morale of a nearby ally, restoring their stress or granting them drive. Or, if using a side sheet, you can recover its tags.\nIn the case that you apply drive to a roll and succeed at a cost, you gain both boons (from the drive) and banes (from succeeding at a cost). In this case, you can spend your boons first, and then the GM spends banes.\nTension # As a bane, the GM can choose to add one or more points of tension to the session. You can represent tension with any kind of tokens clearly visible at the center of the play area. When there’s tension in play, any failure can result in worse consequences. At any point when inflicting banes, the GM can choose to add any points of tension to increase the number of banes inflicted. For example, if there is three tension in play and a player’s roll results in a failure or lower, the GM can choose whether to spend each of those points of tension to add an additional bane for each tension spent (in this case, up to three). Tension is preserved between sessions.\nStory Rewards and Complications # When a player selects the Gain a story reward boon option, they may spend any amount of boons they have to gain a surprise narrative benefit of the GM\u0026rsquo;s choice, roughly proportional to the amount of boons spent. For example, a story reward could earn a player a new ally, a shiny piece of loot, a convenient discovery, or decreased difficulties for the rest of the scene.\nSimilarly, when a GM selects the Complicate the story bane option, they do the same with narrative obstacles. For example, a story complication could introduce new danger to a scene, force the players to make a difficult choice, or even give the players a negative reputation in the future.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/character-stats/stress/","title":"Stress","section":"Character Stats","content":" Stress and Rest # Stress represents physical injury and hurt morale, with each character taking up to a maximum of eight stress before being out. If you’re out, your character is still alive but cannot attempt or succeed at any rolls until recovered through rest. You cannot recover the stress of a character who is out through boons.\nWhen you take stress, mark out bubbles on the stress track from left to right equal to the amount of stress taken. The stress track has star penalties for reaching certain levels of stress. While you have 2-3 stress, all rolls you make have a penalty of 1✦. While you have 4-5 stress, increase that penalty to 2✦. While you have 6-7 stress, increase that penalty to 3✦.\nIf a character rests for a considerable period of time (8-24 hours) in a non-stressful and safe environment, they rest. When you rest, clear all your stress and recover all your tags.\nDeath # By default, your character cannot die unless you choose for them to. If or when you choose for your character to die, they can accomplish any one task they are technically capable of in the moment, automatically succeeding at any rolls required, as long as the Game Master approves. For example, if a dragon is about to destroy your character\u0026rsquo;s home village and all hope is lost, you can choose to kill your character in order to charge into combat and kill the dragon before it causes any damage. If the GM approves, it happens and your character dies.\nIf your character dies, you can create a new character for the GM to incorporate into the story whenever they can. You can optionally create a new character with additional experience equal to the amount the players have gained throughout the course of the campaign.\nOptionally, if you\u0026rsquo;d like more risk of character death, when you become out in an appropriate moment, with your consent, the GM can call for you to make a death roll. Roll a twenty-sided die. On a result of 1, your character dies. On a result of 20, your character recovers one stress and stops being out. On any other result, your character remains alive but still out.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/character-stats/drive/","title":"Drive","section":"Character Stats","content":" Drive # Drive is a meta-resource that players can use to boost their rolls. When rolling, you optionally spend up to five drive to gain that amount of stars, plus that amount of boons on a success or higher (not multiplied by critical effects). Describe what unique strategy your character is using or why this attempt is particularly important to them.\nDrive represents not only a player character\u0026rsquo;s level of motivation, but every narrative detail that is not already a tag on a character sheet. For example, if a character is trying to sneak around in the rain and they apply drive, they could argue that the cover of the weather might help them be stealthier.\nYou can gain drive through the following methods:\nFailing rolls Boons Regard Regard # Whenever another player character does something that makes an impression or furthers your relationship with them, whether positively or negatively, you can mark one or two regard on your character sheet to grant them the same amount of drive. Once you have marked two regard, you cannot mark more in that session. At the start of each session, erase all regard you have marked.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/character-stats/experience/","title":"Experience","section":"Character Stats","content":" Experience # At the end of each session, you gain 5 experience points. GMs can grant additional experience points or tags to one or more players as they see fit as a reward for accomplishing objectives in the campaign or for excellent roleplaying. If the GM awards experience points for roleplaying, all players gain the experience, not just the player(s) responsible for the roleplaying.\nDuring play, you can narrate your character’s training or progress to spend that experience on acquiring new tags or upgrading existing ones. How did they acquire this new or improved tag? For example, you can narrate an arduous training session at a dojo and spend the appropriate amount of experience to upgrade a Martial Arts tag from 2✦ to 3✦. If you are spending experience points to acquire a tag that\u0026rsquo;s an item, you can for example visit a shop and spend the experience there. For a full list of progression options, see the Experience Table.\nThere is no monetary currency in this system, only experience points.\nIf your character is one of the owners of a side sheet, you can also spend your experience points to upgrade the side sheet\u0026rsquo;s tags.\nAssuming players gain an average of six experience points per session, increasing all your starting tags to 5✦ takes around 30 sessions of play.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/gameplay/action-scenes/","title":"Action Scenes","section":"Gameplay","content":" Action Scenes # Action scenes are critical moments of gameplay where the narration of the game goes from a conversational flow to a more structured turn-based flow. Time slows down and every decision matters. For example, a combat against some bandits or a car chase are action scenes.\nIn action scenes, the GM first establishes which sides are participating in the scene (usually just the players and their enemies, but there could be a third side as well) and which side starts. Each side takes one turn at a time. When it’s the players’ side’s turn, one member of that side can take the following actions:\nMove from one place to another Make one roll Make a second roll (requires that you spend a total of four drive and/or stress) Then, the opposing side takes a turn. However, only players roll dice. Whenever other characters or enemies act, the GM imposes a roll on one or more players. A member of a side cannot take another turn until all members of that side have taken a turn.\nCombat # Combat is a type of action scene where the players fight enemies. Enemies have the following attributes:\nA difficulty, ranging from 10 to 25 An HP value, ranging from 1 to around 10 A list of tags, each with a star value ranging from 1-5 For example, the following is a mid-level enemy:\nYoung Red Dragon\nDifficulty: 10 HP: 8 Tags: Fire Breath 4✦ Flying 3✦ Hardy Scales 3✦ Tail Swipe 2✦ Snapping Jaws 1✦ Razor Claws 1✦ When attacking an enemy, make a roll against their difficulty plus an additional tag of the GM’s choice. An enemy’s tags are not exhausted after use. Instead, the enemy cannot use that same tag again until they have used all other tags at least once. If the roll is successful, the player applies damage to the enemy’s HP based on the Outcomes Table.\nWhen defending against an enemy, the player rolls defensively against the difficulty plus an additional tag of the GM’s choice. If successful, the player can also apply damage when attacked, as per the Outcomes Table.\nExample Combat Roll # For example, a player chooses to attack the above Young Red Dragon, using their Combat stat (3✦), Broadsword (2✦), and one drive (1✦). In response, the Young Red Dragon uses its Tail Swipe (2✦) to try to keep its distance from the player character. This results in a modifier of +6 for the player (plus one boon if successful) and a difficulty of 12. The player rolls a 20 and scores a critical success, dealing 2 damage to the Young Red Dragon, bringing it down to 6 HP remaining. Because the attack resulted in a critical success, the player gains boons based on the Difficulty Table, gaining 2 boons (plus 1 from the spent drive) as per the difficulty 12 row.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/optional-rules/side-sheets/","title":"Side Sheets","section":"Optional Rules","content":" Side Sheets # If the narrative includes a character, pet, sidekick, organization, or other entity that trascends the scope of a tag and warrants its own character sheet, then the GM can create a side sheet for that character.\nAs the GM, download or print side sheets and fill out the following information for them:\nName: The entity\u0026rsquo;s name Owners: The list of player characters that can make rolls through this side sheet Stats: The list of stats, which could follow the standard rules of character creation or whatever the GM decides Tags: The list of tags, which could follow the standard rules of character creation or whatever the GM decides Side sheets do not have experience, drive, or stress. The side sheet\u0026rsquo;s owners can control the entity, roleplay as it, decide its actions, and make rolls through it.\nWhen the side sheet\u0026rsquo;s entity attempts something risky, use the standard rules for rolling, with the following exceptions:\nOne of the side sheet\u0026rsquo;s owners must become the roller, making the roll. The roller adds the side sheet\u0026rsquo;s relevant stat, can exhaust up to one of the side sheet\u0026rsquo;s tags to add its bonus, and can spend any amount of drive from their own character sheet to form the roll\u0026rsquo;s bonus. If the side sheet takes stress, the roller can choose to take all of that stress instead. If the side sheet takes one or more points of stress, it becomes out. Flip the side sheet to its backside. When the side sheet\u0026rsquo;s entity can rest, turn it faceup again and recover its tags. If the roller earns boons, they can spend them to recover the side sheet\u0026rsquo;s tags. A side sheet\u0026rsquo;s owners can spend their own experience points to upgrade its tags.\nExample Side Sheet and Roll # All of the player characters are spies belonging to the same intelligence organization, the CIA, which can provide support to them during missions. Instead of all the player characters having a tag called CIA Support, the GM decides that it\u0026rsquo;s more appropriate to give the organization a side sheet.\nFirst, the GM names the side sheet \u0026ldquo;CIA\u0026rdquo; and marks down every player character as one of the owners.\nThen, the GM designs the following stats and gives them to the side sheet:\nGadgetry (GAD) 5✦ Reconnaisance (REC) 4✦ Contacts (CON) 3✦ Weaponry (WEA) 2✦ Transportation (TRA) 1✦ Finally, the GM designs the following tags and gives them to the side sheet:\nSports Car Garage 3✦ Allies with MI6 2✦ Laboratory Interns 1✦ During play, one of the player characters, Agent Nat, needs a quick getaway after a heist at the Russian embassy, so they call for CIA backup. The GM calls for a Transportation roll with a difficulty of 16. Nat\u0026rsquo;s player, the roller, adds the CIA\u0026rsquo;s Transportation stars (1✦), chooses to exhaust the Sports Car Garage tag to add its stars (3✦), and chooses to spend three of their own drive, for a total bonus of +7. Nat\u0026rsquo;s player makes the roll and gets a natural 20, chooses not to double down, and earns a critical success and a total of nine boons (six by default, plus three from the spent drive). They choose to spend two of those boons to recover the CIA\u0026rsquo;s Sports Car Garage tag, six to gain three drive, and one to recover one stress.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/reference/","title":"Reference","section":"Double Down SRD","content":" Reference # Outcomes # Outcome Effect Combat Legendary Success Gain 4x boons 15 damage Overwhelming Success Gain 2x boons 7 damage Critical Success Gain boons 3 damage Success - 1 damage Failure Suffer banes - Critical Failure Suffer 2x banes - Overwhelming Failure Suffer 4x banes - Legendary Failure Suffer 8x banes - Difficulty # Category Difficulty Boons Banes Easy 10-12 2 1 Medium 13-15 4 2 Hard 16-18 6 3 Expert 19-21 8 4 Master 22-24 10 5 Impossible 25+ 12 6 Boons # Cost Effect 1 boon Recover stress 2 boons Recover tag 2 boons Gain drive X boons Gain a story reward Banes # Cost Effect 1 bane Inflict stress 2 banes Add tension X banes Complicate the story Experience # Cost Effect 1 experience Gain a new 1✦ tag 3 experience Upgrade a 1✦ tag to 2✦ 5 experience Upgrade a 2✦ tag to 3✦ 7 experience Upgrade a 3✦ tag to 4✦ 9 experience Upgrade a 4✦ tag to 5✦ Storytelling Requirements # Context Requirement When applying drive\u0026hellip; What unique strategy are you using to give you an advantage, or why is this attempt particularly important to you?
