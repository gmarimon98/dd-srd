If the narrative includes an entity such as a character, pet, sidekick, or organization that is important enough to warrant its own character sheet, then the GM can choose to create a side sheet for that character.
As the GM, download or print a side sheet and fill it out with the following information:

Name: The entity&rsquo;s name
Owners: The list of player characters that can make rolls through this side sheet
Stats: The list of stats, which could follow the standard rules of character creation or whatever the GM decides
Tags: The list of tags, which could follow the standard rules of character creation or whatever the GM decides

Side sheets do not have experience, drive, or stress. The side sheet&rsquo;s owners can control the entity, roleplay as it, decide its actions, and make rolls through it.">

<p>If the narrative includes an entity such as a character, pet, sidekick, or organization that is important enough to warrant its own character sheet, then the GM can choose to create a side sheet for that character.</p>
<p>As the GM, download or print a <a href="/downloads/">side sheet</a> and fill it out with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: The entity&rsquo;s name</li>
<li><strong>Owners</strong>: The list of player characters that can make rolls through this side sheet</li>
<li><strong>Stats</strong>: The list of stats, which could follow the standard rules of character creation or whatever the GM decides</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong>: The list of tags, which could follow the standard rules of character creation or whatever the GM decides</li>
</ul>
<p>Side sheets do not have experience, drive, or stress. The side sheet&rsquo;s owners can control the entity, roleplay as it, decide its actions, and make rolls through it.</p>
<p>When the side sheet&rsquo;s entity attempts something risky, use the standard rules for rolling, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the side sheet&rsquo;s owners must become the roller, making the roll.</li>
<li>To form the roll&rsquo;s bonus, the roller uses the side sheet&rsquo;s stats and tags and can use their own drive.</li>
<li>If the side sheet takes stress, the roller can choose to take that stress instead. If the side sheet takes one or more points of stress, it becomes OUT. To remember, flip the side sheet to its backside. When the side sheet&rsquo;s entity rests, turn it faceup again and recover its tags.</li>
<li>If the roller earns boons, they can spend them to recover the side sheet&rsquo;s tags.</li>
</ol>
<p>A side sheet&rsquo;s owners can spend their own experience points to upgrade its tags.</p>

  Example Side Sheet and Roll
  <a class="anchor" href="#example-side-sheet-and-roll">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In this example campaign, the player characters are spies belonging to an organization called Ares Intelligence, which they can radio for support during missions. Instead of all the characters simply having a tag called <code>Ares Intelligence</code>, the GM decides that the organization warrants its own side sheet.</p>
<p>First, the GM names the side sheet &ldquo;Ares Intelligence&rdquo; and marks down every player character as one of the owners.</p>
<p>Then, the GM designs the following stats and gives them to the side sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel (INT)</strong> 5✦</li>
<li><strong>Politics (POL)</strong> 4✦</li>
<li><strong>Weaponry (WEA)</strong> 4✦</li>
<li><strong>Contacts (CON)</strong> 3✦</li>
<li><strong>Technology (TEC)</strong> 2✦</li>
<li><strong>Resources (RES)</strong> 2✦</li>
<li><strong>Transport (TRA)</strong> 1✦</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the GM designs the following tags and gives them to the side sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Sports Car Garage</code> 3✦</li>
<li><code>Ally with MI6</code> 2✦</li>
<li><code>Laboratory Interns</code> 1✦</li>
</ul>
<p>During play, one of the player characters, Agent Little, needs to make a quick getaway after a heist at a Russian embassy. So, they choose to radio for Ares backup:</p>
<ol>
<li>The GM calls for a Transport roll with a difficulty of 16.</li>
<li>Agent Little&rsquo;s player, the roller, adds Ares&rsquo; Transport (1✦), chooses to exhaust its <code>Sports Car Garage</code> tag (3✦), and chooses to spend three of their own drive, for a total bonus of +7.</li>
<li>They roll and get a natural 20 and choose not to double down, resulting in a critical success and a total of nine boons (six by default, plus three from the spent drive).</li>
<li>They choose to spend two of those boons to recover Ares&rsquo; <code>Sports Car Garage</code> tag, six to gain three drive, and one to recover one stress.</li>
</ol>
