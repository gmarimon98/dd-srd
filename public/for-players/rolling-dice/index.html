  #

Whenever your character attempts something risky, the GM may call for a roll. Rolls have the following steps:


Set Base Skill and Difficulty. The GM calls for a roll, setting a base skill (from the list of nine) and a difficulty (ranging from 6-30).


Add Stars. You create your die modifier by adding the stars on your character sheet from the following sources to form a total, ranging from -2 to &#43;18. The sum of all the stars is your modifier; for example, 6✦ results in a modifier of &#43;6.">

<p>Whenever your character attempts something risky, the GM may call for a roll. Rolls have the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Set Base Skill and Difficulty.</strong> The GM calls for a roll, setting a base skill (from the list of nine) and a difficulty (ranging from 6-30).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Stars.</strong> You create your die modifier by adding the stars on your character sheet from the following sources to form a total, ranging from -2 to +18. The sum of all the stars is your modifier; for example, 6✦ results in a modifier of +6.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must add the roll’s base skill, which ranges from 1✦ to 5✦.</li>
<li>You can optionally exhaust up to one relevant tag to add it (also ranging from 1✦ to 5✦). You can also exhaust a tag irrelevant to the attempt with a -1✦ penalty. After exhausting a tag, you cannot add it to other rolls until you recover it by resting or using boons. To mark it is exhausted, fill in the circle to the left of the tag on the character sheet.</li>
<li>You can optionally add up to five drive, which are spent and you must erase from your sheet, with each drive granting you 1✦ and one boon if your outcome at the end of the roll is a success or higher. This drive boon is not multiplied by any tiers of success in the Outcomes Table. If you choose to apply drive, you must describe what unique strategy your character is using or why this attempt is particularly important to them.</li>
<li>You must add stars from a positive condition if you have one, and subtract stars from a negative condition if you have one. After the roll, you can describe how any specific negative condition you may have affected your attempt to reduce its stars by one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Roll.</strong> You roll a 20-sided die and add your modifier. Then, based on the result, you achieve the following outcome, with critical outcomes taking priority over regular outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the number on the die is a 20, your outcome is a critical success.</li>
<li>If the number on the die is a 1, your outcome is a critical failure.</li>
<li>If the total value rolled is greater to or equal than the difficulty, your outcome is a success.</li>
<li>If the total value rolled is less than the difficulty, your outcome is a failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose a Post-Roll Action.</strong> Depending on your outcome, you can optionally choose one of the following post-roll actions to modify it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double Down.</strong> Regardless of your roll’s outcome, you can choose to double down. If you double down, roll the same die again, adding the same modifier and comparing the result to the same difficulty. If you succeed the second roll, your original outcome is increased by one tier as per the Outcomes Table. If you critically succeed at the second roll, your outcome is increased by two tiers. If you fail the second roll, your outcome is decreased by one tier. If you critically fail the second roll, your outcome is decreased by two tiers. For example, increasing a Failure outcome by two tiers results in a Critical Success.</li>
<li><strong>Succeed at a Cost.</strong> If your outcome is a non-critical failure, you can choose to succeed at a cost. If you succeed at a cost, you succeed but incur banes equal to the difference between your total value rolled and the difficulty. For example, if you rolled a total of 14, but the difficulty was 16, you can succeed at a cost to succeed at the cost of 2 banes.</li>
<li><strong>Fold.</strong> If your outcome is a failure or critical failure, you can choose to fold. If you fold, you fail but gain one additional drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculate Boons and Banes.</strong> With your final outcome, the GM refers to the Outcomes Table, calculating any resulting boons or banes based on the roll’s difficulty using the Difficulty Table. If the outcome has the effect “2x boons/banes,” the GM multiplies the number of boons or banes by the appropriate number, not multiplying any boons from drive. If you have any boons, you can spend them on effects from the Boons table. If you have any banes, the GM can spend them on effects from the Banes table. If in combat, the roll applies damage as stated in the Outcomes Table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gain Drive.</strong> If you fail the roll, you can describe why your character failed and attempt to connect it to the character’s flaws. If you do so, gain one drive. If you chose to fold in Step 4, gain two instead.</p>
</li>
</ol>
