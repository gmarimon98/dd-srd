# Character Creation

To create a character, first brainstorm character concepts that suit the tone and setting and tone of your game with your group, ideally in a Session Zero. Once you have a character concept you're happy with, follow these steps:

1. **Get a Character Sheet.** The Double Down character sheet PDF is [available for download](https://1drv.ms/b/c/391fe1ecd2a3c6fc/EcLm-nAlkyxAhIphdENLOBMBleH7MgqELQP_HNhcn5sHOg?e=7AyqeS).

2. **Fill in Character Details.** Write your character's name at the top of the sheet, then fill in each field below with your character's personal details (such as Motivations and Flaws). This section has no mehcanical or gameplay effect and only exists to help you further develop your character, so feel free to skip this step if you want more time to brainstorm your character's personality.

3. **Rank your Stats.** From the list of nine default [stats]({{< relref "/character-stats/stats" >}}), select one to have 5✦, two to have 4✦, three to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦. Fill in the appropriate number of stars for each on your character sheet. You cannot upgrade or change these values in the future, so make sure you’re happy with them.

    - One of the nine stats is an intentionally blank field. The GM can determine what this stat is to accommodate the setting. Ask the GM what stat they have selected and write it on the blank stat field on your sheet.

4. **Create Tags.** Tags are narrative details about your character, each with a level from 1✦ to 5✦, that can provide a bonus to your rolls. Create four tags with 3✦, four tags with 2✦, and four tags with 1✦. For example, tags can be the following:

    - Tags can represent who your character is and what forms their identity. For example, `Scientist`, `Elf`, `Gigantic`, `Stubborn`, `Head of the Council`, and `Good Dad`.

    - Tags can represent external items or allies your character has access to. For example, `Pet Cat`, `Assault Rifle`, `Full-Plate Armor`, `Haunted RV`, `Loyal Butler`, and `Back-Alley Hideout`.

    - Tags can represent special powers or moves your character can use. For example, `Fireball`, `Deduction`, `Telekinesis`, `Necromancy`, `Wrestling`, and `Biology`.

    - The GM can require that one or more of your tags fit into categories of their choice based on the campaign. For example, in a traditional medieval fantasy game, the GM might require that you have one tag for your species (for example, `Orc` or `Halfling`), one for your class (for example, `Magic User` or `Acrobat`), and one for your background (for example, `Mercenary` or `Farmer`).

If your GM approves of your character sheet, your character is done and now ready to play. All other fields (experience, stress, and drive) start out blank.
