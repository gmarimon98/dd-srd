# Character Creation

To create a character, first brainstorm character concepts that suit the tone and setting and tone of your game with your group, ideally in a Session Zero. Once you have a character concept you're happy with, follow these steps:

1. **Get a Character Sheet.** The form-fillable Double Down character sheet PDF is [available for download](TODO).

2. **Fill in Character Details.** Write your character's name at the top of the sheet, then fill in each field below with your character's personal details (such as Motivations and Flaws). This section has no mehcanical or gameplay effect and only exists to help you further develop your character, so feel free to skip this step if you want more time to brainstorm your character's personality.

3. **Rank your Skills.** From the list of nine default skills, select one to have 5✦, two to have 4✦, three to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦. Fill in the appropriate number of stars for each on your character sheet. You cannot upgrade or change these values in the future, so make sure you’re happy with them.

    - One of the nine skills is an intentionally blank field. The GM can determine what this skill is to accommodate the setting. Ask the GM what skill they have selected and write it on the blank skill field on your sheet.

4. **Create Tags.** Tags are narrative details about your character, each with a level from 1✦ to 5✦, that can provide a bonus to your rolls. The following are the three types of tags.

    1. **Create Traits.** In the Traits section, write six tags representing who your character is and what forms their identity. Example traits include `Scientist`, `Elf`, `Gigantic`, `Stubborn`, `Head of the Council`, and `Good Dad`. Select two to have 3✦, two to have 2✦, and two to have 1✦. 

    2. **Create Assets.** In the Assets section, write three tags representing external items or allies your character has access to. Example assets include `Pet Cat`, `Assault Rifle`, `Full-Plate Armor`, `Haunted RV`, `Loyal Butler`, and `Back-Alley Hideout`. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦. 

    3. **Create Abilities.** In the Abilities section, write three tags representing special powers or moves your character can use. Example abilities include `Fireball`, `Deduction`, `Telekinesis`, `Necromancy`, `Wrestling`, and `Biology`. Select one to have 3✦, one to have 2✦, and one to have 1✦.

5. **Fill in Drive.** Fill in the two stars under the Drive section.

6. **Write Conflict(s).** Optionally, write one or more of your character’s struggles, themes, or conflicts under the Conflicts section. Example conflicts include `New to Parenthood`, `Nature vs. Nurture`, `Refusing my Destiny`, and `Fighting for Freedom`. If you can’t think of any immediately, feel free to skip this section. You can add or modify conflicts whenever you want during play.

If your GM approves of your character sheet, your character is done and now ready to play. All other fields (experience, stress, conditions, and drive) start out blank.
