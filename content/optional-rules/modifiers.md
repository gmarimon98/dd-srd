# Modifiers

The GM can incorporate any of the following rules adjustments to suit their campaign:

* **Death Roll**: When a character would become OUT in a context where they might die, the GM can call for a death roll. The player must roll a D20 with no bonus. If they roll a 1 or a 2, their character dies. If they roll a 19 or a 20, they recover one stress. If they roll anything else, they become OUT normally.

* **Random Stats**: When creating a character, instead of assigning stats normally, instead roll 1D10 for each stat in order and divide each result by two, rounding up.

* **Player Weakness**: When creating a character, you must create a number of weaknesses determined by your GM (usually 1 or 2). Write them down in unused tag slots. When those weaknesses are invoked during a roll, increase the difficulty by one for each.

* **Corruption**: Whenever you fail a roll to prevent corruption (for example, insanity, cyberpsychosis, or evil), the GM can describe whatever your character does next in reaction; for example, scream loudly, run away, or drop their weapon. When you become OUT as the result of a roll to prevent corruption, the GM gives you a new 1✦ tag for the sign of corruption you develop (for example, a phobia, a glitch, or an evil impulse). Whenever you exhaust this tag, you take one stress. You can level this tag up as normal.

* **Investigation**: When investigating or searching for clues, players can spend one boon to ask an additional question that their character could plausibly deduce the answer to based on the information available, which the GM must answer thruthfully. For example, a player could ask "Has anything in the crime scene been tampered with?" or "Was this a violent crime?" and get truthful answers. However, they could not ask "Who is the culprit?" if the GM determines that the character could not deduce that yet based on the present evidence.

* **Flashback**: During play, a player can spend one drive to flash back in the narrative to attempt a roll in the past that affects the current situation. For example, before having to sneak past some guards, a player can spend one drive to describe how they actually attempted to bribe those guards in the past, which the GM determines requires a Charisma roll. Flashbacks cannot affect events that the session has already canonized.
