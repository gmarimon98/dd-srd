# Modifiers

The GM can incorporate any of the following rules adjustments to suit their campaign:

* **Death Roll**: When a character would become OUT in a context where they might die, the GM can call for a death roll. The player must roll a D20 with no bonus. If they roll a 1 or a 2, their character dies. If they roll a 19 or a 20, they recover one stress. If they roll anything else, they become OUT normally.

* **Random Stats**: When creating a character, instead of assigning stats normally, roll 1D10 for each stat in order and divide each result by two, rounding up. For example, for Toughness, if you roll a 5, then the stat is 3✦.

* **Player Weakness**: When creating a character, you must create a number of weaknesses determined by your GM (usually 1 or 2). Write them down in unused tag slots. When those weaknesses are invoked during a roll, increase the difficulty by one for each.

* **Corruption**: Whenever you fail a roll to prevent corruption (for example, insanity, cyberpsychosis, or evil), the GM can describe whatever your character does next in reaction; for example, scream loudly, run away, or drop their weapon. When you become OUT as the result of a roll to prevent corruption, the GM gives you a new 1✦ tag for the sign of corruption you develop (for example, a phobia, a glitch, or an evil impulse). Whenever you exhaust this tag, you take one stress. You can level this tag up as normal.

* **Flashback**: During play, a player can spend one drive to flash back in the narrative to attempt a roll in the past that affects the current situation. For example, before having to sneak past some guards, a player can spend one drive to describe how they actually attempted to bribe those guards in the past, which the GM determines requires a Charisma roll. Flashbacks cannot affect events that the session has already canonized.
