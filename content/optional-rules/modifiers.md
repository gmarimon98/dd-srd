# Modifiers

The GM can incorporate any of the following rules adjustments to suit their campaign:

* **Death Roll**: When a character would become OUT in a context where they might die, the GM can call for a death roll. The player must roll a D20 with no bonus. If they roll a 1, their character dies. If they roll a 20, they recover one stress. If they roll anything else, they become OUT normally.
