# Welcome to Double Down

Double Down is a rules-light, generic D20 TTRPG system geared toward roleplaying, featuring a core push-your-luck mechanic. The rules are completely free and playing only requires the following additional materials:

* a [character sheet](https://1drv.ms/b/c/391fe1ecd2a3c6fc/EcLm-nAlkyxAhIphdENLOBMBleH7MgqELQP_HNhcn5sHOg?e=7AyqeSxirUyK) per player
* one or more [reference sheets](https://1drv.ms/i/c/391fe1ecd2a3c6fc/ERBCDJFjYnpMpB6kVVy7vs0BvAQuyGGWtTzqnGjvrgy1CA?e=3kFI2F) to share 
* one or more 20-sided dice to share

I designed Double Down in my free time for personal use. If you enjoy the system and have any stories or feedback, please reach out to me at doubledown.rpg@gmail.com. 🤍
