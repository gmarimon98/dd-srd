# Experience

At the end of each session, you gain 5 experience points. GMs can grant additional experience points or tags to all players as they see fit as a reward for accomplishing objectives in the campaign, acquiring wealth, or roleplaying well. If the GM awards additional experience points in this way, all players gain them.

You can spend experience at any time, even outside a session or right before a roll, to gain new tags or upgrade existing ones. For a full list of progression options, see the [**Experience Table**]({{< relref "/reference#experience" >}}). 

Optionally, you can describe how your character got this improvement. For example, you can narrate an arduous training session at a dojo and spend the appropriate amount of experience to upgrade a `Martial Arts` tag from 2✦ to 3✦. Or, if you are spending experience points to acquire a tag that's an item, you can for example visit a shop and spend the experience there.

There is no monetary currency in this system, only experience points.

If your character is one of the owners of a [side sheet]({{< relref "/optional-rules/side-sheets" >}}), you can also spend your experience points to upgrade the side sheet's tags.

## Refund Tags

With the GM's permission, you can refund any tag that no longer applies to your character. If you refund a tag, erase it from your sheet and gain experience equal to [how much that tag would have cost to gain]({{< relref "/reference#experience" >}}). For example, you can refund a 3✦ tag to gain 9 experience back.

You can also partially refund a tag by downgrading its level. For example, you can downgrade a tag from 4✦ to 3✦ and gain 7 experience back.

You can use tag refunding and downgrading to support the narrative of an evolving character. For example, if your character starts out as a `Scared Kid` but eventually becomes an `Experienced Soldier`, you can downgrade the former tag as your character becomes more experienced and eventually replace it with the latter tag.
