# Experience

At the end of each session, you gain 5 experience points. GMs can grant additional experience points or tags to all players as they see fit as a reward for accomplishing objectives in the campaign, acquiring wealth, or roleplaying well. If the GM awards additional experience points in this way, all players gain them.

You can spend experience at any time, even outside a session or right before a roll, to gain new tags or upgrade existing ones. For a full list of progression options, see the [**Experience Table**]({{< relref "/reference#experience" >}}). 

Optionally, you can describe how your character got this improvement. For example, you can narrate an arduous training session at a dojo and spend the appropriate amount of experience to upgrade a `Martial Arts` tag from 2✦ to 3✦. Or, if you are spending experience points to acquire a tag that's an item, you can for example visit a shop and spend the experience there.

There is no monetary currency in this system, only experience points.

If your character is one of the owners of a [side sheet]({{< relref "/optional-rules/side-sheets" >}}), you can also spend your experience points to upgrade the side sheet's tags.
