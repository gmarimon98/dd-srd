# Experience

At the end of each session, you gain 5 experience points. GMs can grant additional experience points or tags to one or more players as they see fit as a reward for accomplishing objectives in the campaign.

During play, you can narrate your character’s training or progress to spend that experience on acquiring new tags or upgrading existing ones. How did they acquire this new or improved tag? For example, you can narrate an arduous training session at a dojo and spend the appropriate amount of experience to upgrade a `Martial Arts` tag from 2✦ to 3✦. If you are spending experience points to acquire a tag that's an item, you can for example visit a shop and spend the experience there. For a full list of progression options, see the [**Experience Table**]({{< relref "/reference#experience" >}}).

There is no monetary currency in this system, only experience points.

Assuming players take full advantage of the character development mechanic to gain an additional 1 experience per session (for a total of 6), increasing all your starting tags to 5✦ takes around 30 sessions of play.

## Character Development

Once per session, when your character deals with a struggle important to them, shows meaningful growth, drives the story forward in a unique and personal way, or leans into their flaws, you can claim that your character develops and gain 1 experience point.
