# Experience

At the end of each session, you gain 5 experience points. GMs can grant additional experience points or tags to all players as they see fit as a reward for accomplishing objectives in the campaign, acquiring wealth, or roleplaying well. If the GM awards additional experience points in this way, all players gain them. If the GM awards a tag to one or more players, other players receive experience equal to the value of that tag. For example, if a player receives a 2✦ `Cloak of Flying`, other players receive 3 experience.

You can spend experience at any time with GM approval, even outside a session or right before a roll, to gain new tags or upgrade existing ones. For a full list of progression options, see the [**Experience Table**]({{< relref "/reference#experience" >}}).

Spending experience must fit within the story and setting. For example, if you are playing a traditional medieval fantasy game, the GM can prevent you from getting an `Alien Plasma Rifle`. If you want to gain a `Scroll of Teleportation`, you must first find the opportunity to acquire such an item in the story, for example by finding it in a dungeon or visiting a shop that has it in stock and spending the experience there. If you want to gain access to a specific new tag, consider letting your GM know so they can give you the opportunity to acquire it in the story.

There is no monetary currency in this system, only experience points.

If your character is one of the owners of a [side sheet]({{< relref "/optional-rules/side-sheets" >}}), you can also spend your experience points to upgrade the side sheet's tags.

## Refund Tags

With the GM's permission, you can refund any tag that no longer applies to your character. If you refund a tag, erase it from your sheet and gain experience equal to [how much that tag would have cost to gain]({{< relref "/reference#experience" >}}). For example, you can refund a 3✦ tag to gain 9 experience back.

You can also partially refund a tag by downgrading its level. For example, you can downgrade a tag from 4✦ to 3✦ and gain 7 experience back.

You can use tag refunding and downgrading to support the narrative of an evolving character. For example, if your character starts out as a `Scared Kid` but eventually becomes an `Experienced Soldier`, you can downgrade the former tag as your character becomes more experienced and eventually replace it with the latter tag.

If a tag represents a consumable resource, such as a `Healing Potion` or a `Box of Dynamite`, then the GM can request that the player refund one or all levels for the tag after use, regardless of the roll's outcome. For example, if a 5✦ `Healing Potion` is a one-use item, then the GM can request that the player refund it entirely after use. If a 3✦ `Box of Dynamite` would eventually run out of dynamite, the GM can resquest that the player refund one level after each use, from 3✦ to 2✦ in this example.
