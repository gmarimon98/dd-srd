# Experience

At the end of each session, you gain 5 experience points. GMs can grant additional experience points or tags to one or more players as they see fit as a reward for accomplishing objectives in the campaign.

During play, you can narrate your character’s training or progress to spend that experience on acquiring new tags or upgrading existing ones. How did they acquire this new or improved tag? For example, you can narrate an arduous training session at a dojo and spend the appropriate amount of experience to upgrade a `Martial Arts` ability from 2✦ to 3✦. If you are spending experience points to acquire an asset, you can for example visit a shop and spend the experience there. For a full list of progression options, see the [**Experience Table**]({{< relref "/reference#experience" >}}).

There is no monetary currency in this system, only experience points.

Assuming players can full advantage of the conflicts mechanic to gain an additional 1 experience per session (for a total of 6), increasing all your starting tags to 5✦ takes around 30 sessions of play.

## Conflicts

Whenever you want during play, you can add, remove, or modify up to three conflicts on your character sheet. Conflicts represent goals, themes, and issues that your character struggles with. Example conflicts include `New to Parenthood`, `Nature vs. Nurture`, `Refusing my Destiny`, and `Fighting for Freedom`.

Once per session, whenever you deal with a conflict during play, you can invest either 1 or 2 experience points into that conflict. Remove that amount of experience from your available experience field and add it to the conflict. Then, whenever that conflict reaches some climax, resolution, or progress, you can ask your GM to cash it out in order to regain all experience points you invested in it plus an additional 50% (rounded up). For example, if you cash out a conflict that has accrued 11 experience points, you would regain all 11 plus an additional 6.
