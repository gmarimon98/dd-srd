# Stress and Rest

Stress represents physical injury and hurt morale, with each character taking up to a maximum of eight stress before being out. If you’re out, your character is still alive but cannot attempt or succeed at any rolls until recovered through rest. You cannot recover the stress of a character who is out through boons.

When you take stress, mark out bubbles on the stress track from left to right equal to the amount of stress taken. The stress track has star penalties for reaching certain levels of stress. While you have 2-3 stress, all rolls you make have a penalty of 1✦. While you have 4-5 stress, increase that penalty to 2✦. While you have 6-7 stress, increase that penalty to 3✦.

If a character rests for a considerable period of time (8-24 hours) in a non-stressful and safe environment, they rest. When you rest, clear all your stress and recover all your tags.

## Death

By default, your character cannot die unless you choose for them to. If or when you choose for your character to die, they can accomplish any one task they are technically capable of in the moment, automatically succeeding at any rolls required, as long as the Game Master approves. For example, if a dragon is about to destroy your character's home village and all hope is lost, you can choose to kill your character in order to charge into combat and kill the dragon before it causes any damage. If the GM approves, it happens and your character dies.

If your character dies, you can create a new character for the GM to incorporate into the story whenever they can.

Optionally, if you'd like more risk of character death, when you become out in an appropriate moment, with your consent, the GM can call for you to make a death roll. Roll a twenty-sided die. On a result of 1, your character dies. On a result of 20, your character recovers one stress and stops being out. On any other result, your character remains alive but still out.
