# Stress

Stress represents physical injury and hurt morale, with each character taking up to a maximum of eight stress before being OUT. If you’re OUT, your character is still alive but cannot attempt or succeed at any rolls until recovered through rest. You cannot recover the stress of a character who is OUT through boons.

When you take stress, mark out bubbles on the stress track from left to right equal to the amount of stress taken. The stress track has star bonuses for reaching certain levels of stress. While you have 2-3 stress, all rolls you make have a bonus of 1✦. While you have 4-5 stress, increase that bonus to 2✦. While you have 6-7 stress, increase that bonus to 3✦.

Narratively, this represents your character's increasing determination as their circumstances become grimmer and all hope seems lost.

## Rest

If a character rests for an non-trivial period of time in a non-stressful and safe environment, such as in between sessions, they rest. The GM determines the quality of rest from the following list based on the story. For example, sleeping in a cold cavern with no sleeping bags might result in a short rest, while having a weekend-long vacation at a cozy inn might result in a long rest.

- **Short Rest**: Gain six boons to spend on recovery and drive options from the Boons table.
- **Medium Rest**: Gain ten boons to spend on recovery and drive options from the Boons table.
- **Long Rest**: Gain fourteen boons to spend on recovery and drive options from the Boons table.

## Death

Your character cannot die unless you choose for them to. If you choose for your character to die, they can accomplish any one task they are technically capable of in the moment, automatically succeeding at any rolls required, as long as the GM approves. For example, if a dragon is about to destroy your character's home village and all hope is lost, you can choose to kill your character in order to charge into combat and kill the dragon before it causes any damage. If the GM approves, it happens and your character dies.

If your character dies, you can create a new character for the GM to incorporate into the story whenever they can, beginning with an amount of experience roughly equal to the amount your old character gained.
