# Stress and Rest

Stress represents physical injury and hurt morale, with each character taking up to a maximum of ten stress before being out. If you’re out, your character is still alive but cannot attempt or succeed at any rolls until recovered through rest. You cannot recover the stress of a character who is out through boons.

If a character rests for a considerable period of time (8-24 hours) in a non-stressful and safe environment, they rest. When you rest, clear all your stress and negative conditions and recover all your traits.
