# Drive

Drive is a meta-resource that players can use to boost their rolls. When rolling, you optionally spend up to five drive to gain that amount of stars, plus that amount of boons on a success or higher (not multiplied by critical effects). Describe what unique strategy your character is using or why this attempt is particularly important to them.

Drive represents not only a player character's level of motivation, but every narrative detail that is not already a tag on a character sheet. For example, if a character is trying to sneak around in the rain and they apply drive, they could argue that the cover of the weather might help them be stealthier.

You can gain drive through the following methods:
- [Failing rolls]({{< relref "/gameplay/rolls" >}})
- [Boons]({{< relref "/gameplay/boons-and-banes" >}})
- [Regard](#regard)

## Regard

When roleplaying, if another player character does something that makes an impression or furthers your character's relationship with them, whether positively or negatively, you can mark one or two regard on your character sheet to grant them the same amount of drive. Once you have marked two regard, you cannot mark more in that session. At the start of each session, erase all regard you have marked.

For context, this mechanic is inspired by video game RPGs where certain dialogue choices can further your relationship with NPCs.

Non-player characters can give player characters regard at the GM's discretion.
