# Tags

Tags are narrative details about your character, each with a level from 1✦ to 5✦, that can provide a bonus to your rolls. You can only add one tag to a roll.

The following are the three types of tags. The different types of tags are functionally identical except for your starting amount in each type during character creation.

- Traits represent who your character is and what forms their identity. Example traits include `Scientist`, `Elf`, `Gigantic`, `Stubborn`, `Head of the Council`, and `Good Dad`.

- Assets represent external items or allies your character has access to. Example assets include `Pet Cat`, `Assault Rifle`, `Full-Plate Armor`, `Haunted RV`, `Loyal Butler`, and `Back-Alley Hideout`.

- Abilities represent special powers or moves your character can use. Example abilities include `Fireball`, `Deduction`, `Telekinesis`, `Necromancy`, `Wrestling`, and `Biology`.

Once you exhaust a tag, you cannot benefit from its bonus again until it's recovered. You can recover tags through boons or rest.

A tag being exhausted does not remove its presence in your character or the narrative. For example, if you have the ability `Teleportation` and exhaust it, you can still teleport in the story while it is exhausted. You just can't benefit from the `Teleportation` tag when rolling to do so.
