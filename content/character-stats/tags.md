# Tags

Tags are narrative details about your character, each with a level from 1✦ to 5✦, that can provide a bonus to your rolls. You can only add one tag to a roll.

For example, tags can represent any of the following:

- Tags can represent who your character is and what forms their identity. For example, `Scientist`, `Elf`, `Gigantic`, `Stubborn`, `Head of the Council`, and `Good Dad`.

- Tags can represent external items or allies your character has access to. For example, `Pet Cat`, `Assault Rifle`, `Full-Plate Armor`, `Haunted RV`, `Loyal Butler`, and `Back-Alley Hideout`.

- Tags can represent special powers or moves your character can use. For example, `Fireball`, `Deduction`, `Telekinesis`, `Necromancy`, `Wrestling`, and `Biology`.

Once you exhaust a tag, you cannot benefit from its bonus again until it's recovered. You can recover tags through boons or rest.

A tag being exhausted does not remove its presence in your character or the narrative. For example, if you have the tag `Teleportation` and exhaust it, you can still teleport in the story while it is exhausted. You just can't benefit from the `Teleportation` tag when rolling to do so.

If you have a tag with access to endless creative options, such as `Wizard`, then you cannot use that tag to cast any spell imaginable, for example. Instead, the GM reserves the right to demand that you spend experience to create a new tag for each unique ability or spell that your character has access to.

### Help Creating Tags

If you're having difficulty creating tags for your character, answer questions from the following list to come up with ideas:

- What does your character want?
- What does your character need?
- What makes your character likeable or admirable?
- What makes your character unlikeable or difficult?
- What can your character do better than anyone else?
- How does your character usually solve problems?
- In a critical moment, what ability can your character use to get out of trouble?
- When fighting, how does your character attack or defend?
- Does your character have any tools of the trade, or valuables important to them?
- How is your character different from the others at the table?
