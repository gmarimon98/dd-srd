# Conditions

Conditions are special narrative status effects that either increase (positive conditions) or decrease (negative conditions) your stars before each roll, and then downgrade after the roll. 

For example, a positive 3✦ condition called `Adrenaline Rush` grants 3✦ to your next roll after acquiring it, then 2✦ to the next roll, and then 1✦ to the next roll. After each roll, erase one star from the condition. When a condition affects your roll, you must narrate how that specific condition affected your attempt. For example, if you have the negative condition `Limping` and are trying to attack an enemy, you can describe how your character struggles to maintain their balance (or roleplay it).

You can gain conditions through boons or banes. On your character sheet, you have one slot for a positive condition and one for a negative condition. If you have both a positive and a negative, they increase or decrease your stars equal to the difference. For example, having a 3✦ positive condition and a 2✦ negative condition nets you an additional 1✦. If you gain another condition of the same type (positive or negative) when you already have one, you must choose which condition to keep and discard the other.
