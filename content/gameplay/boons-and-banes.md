# Boons & Banes

Depending on your outcome, you may gain one or more boons to spend on the [**Boons Table**]({{< relref "/reference#boons" >}}) or one or more banes for the GM to spend on the [**Banes Table**]({{< relref "/reference#banes" >}}).

With a roll's final outcome, the GM refers to the [**Outcomes Table**]({{< relref "/reference#outcomes" >}}) to determine whether you earned boons or incurred banes, keeping note of any multiplier the outcome may list. If the outcome results in boons or banes, the GM then refers to the [**Difficulty Table**]({{< relref "/reference#difficulty" >}}) to see how many, multiplying the total by the multiplier in the Outcomes table. Boons from drive are not multiplied in this way.

When selecting boons or banes, the target of the effect does not need to be the player character rolling, as long as the alternative is narratively justified. For example, if a player gets a critical success, they can spend the resulting boons to raise the morale of a nearby ally, restoring their stress or granting them drive. Or, if using a [side sheet]({{< relref "/optional-rules/side-sheets" >}}), you can recover its tags.

## Tension

As a bane, the GM can choose to add one or more points of tension to the session. You can represent tension with any kind of tokens clearly visible at the center of the play area. At any point, the GM can spend any amount of tension to inflict the same amount of banes. Tension is preserved between sessions.

## Story Rewards and Complications

When a player selects the **Gain a story reward** boon option, they may spend any amount of boons they have to gain a surprise narrative benefit of the GM's choice, roughly proportional to the amount of boons spent. For example, a story reward could earn a player a new ally, a shiny piece of loot, a convenient discovery, or decreased difficulties for the rest of the scene.

Similarly, when a GM selects the **Complicate the story** bane option, they do the same with narrative obstacles. For example, a story complication could introduce new danger to a scene, force the players to make a difficult choice, or even give the players a negative reputation in the future.
